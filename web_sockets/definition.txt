#What is WebSocket ?

WebSocket is a new communication protocol introduced with HTML5, mainly to be implemented by web clients and servers,
though it can also be implemented outside of the web.

Unlike HTTP connections, a WebSocket connection is a permanent, bi-directional communication channel between a client
and the server, where either one can initiate an exchange.
Once established, the connection remains available until one of the parties disconnects from it.

WebSocket connections are useful for games or web sites that need to display live information with very low latency
